# Python OOP Calculator Assignment Guide

## 📚 Understanding the Basics

### Function vs Method in Python

**Function:**
- Called independently (not on an object)
- Example: `result = add(5, 3)`
- Operates on data passed to it
- Returns a value but doesn't modify object state

**Method:**
- Called on an object using dot notation
- Example: `result = calculator.add(5, 3)`
- Can access and modify the object's internal data
- Part of a class

---

## 🎯 Assignment Overview

Create a calculator program that uses **both functions and methods** to perform at least 6 different calculations.

## 📋 Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### **Step 1: Set Up Your File Structure**

Create a file named: `Calculator_[YourName].py`

### **Step 2: Create Standalone Functions**

These are **functions** (not methods) because they don't belong to a class.

```python
# FUNCTIONS - Called directly, not on an object

def add_function(num1, num2):
    """This is a FUNCTION - adds two numbers"""
    return num1 + num2

def subtract_function(num1, num2):
    """This is a FUNCTION - subtracts num2 from num1"""
    return num1 - num2

# Add more functions here (multiply, divide, etc.)
```

### **Step 3: Create a Calculator Class with Methods**

These are **methods** because they belong to a class and are called on objects.

```python
# CLASS with METHODS - Called on an object

class Calculator:
    """Calculator class containing various calculation methods"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        """Constructor - initializes the calculator"""
        self.name = "Basic Calculator"
    
    def add_method(self, num1, num2):
        """This is a METHOD - adds two numbers"""
        return num1 + num2
    
    def power_method(self, base, exponent):
        """This is a METHOD - raises base to the power of exponent"""
        return base ** exponent
    
    # Add more methods here
```

### **Step 4: Build the Menu Loop**

Create a main program that:
1. Displays menu options
2. Gets user choice
3. Validates input
4. Calls appropriate function/method
5. Displays result
6. Loops until user exits

```python
def main():
    """Main program loop"""
    calc = Calculator()  # Create calculator object
    
    while True:
        print("\n=== CALCULATOR MENU ===")
        print("1. Add (using function)")
        print("2. Subtract (using function)")
        print("3. Multiply (using method)")
        print("4. Power (using method)")
        print("5. Hypotenuse (your choice)")
        print("6. Divide (your choice)")
        print("Type 'exit' to quit")
        
        choice = input("\nEnter your choice: ").lower()
        
        # Check for exit
        if choice == 'exit':
            print("Thank you for using the calculator!")
            break
        
        # Validate input
        if choice not in ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6']:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
            continue
        
        # Get numbers from user and perform calculation
        # (You'll implement this part)
```

## ✅ Requirements Checklist

- [ ] **At least 6 calculations** implemented
- [ ] **Mix of functions and methods** (not all the same)
- [ ] **Clear comments** explaining which are functions vs methods
- [ ] **User input validation** (handle invalid choices)
- [ ] **Menu loop** continues until user types "exit"
- [ ] **Each calculation asks for appropriate input** using `input()`
- [ ] **Results displayed** in the main program
- [ ] **Debug print statements commented out** (not deleted)
- [ ] **Proper file naming**: `Calculator_[YourName].py`

---

## 💡 Suggested Calculations

### Required (at least 6):
1. **Add** - sum of two numbers
2. **Subtract** - difference of two numbers
3. **Multiply** - product of two numbers
4. **Divide** - quotient (handle division by zero!)
5. **Hypotenuse** - `√(a² + b²)` for right triangle
6. **Power** - raise base to exponent

### Optional (for extra challenge):
7. **BEDMAS calculator** - handles order of operations
8. **Bracket handler** - evaluates expressions with parentheses

---

## 🔍 Testing Your Program

Test with these scenarios:
- Valid menu choices (1-6)
- Invalid menu choices (7, abc, -1)
- Division by zero
- Negative numbers
- Decimal numbers
- Typing "exit" to quit

---

## 📝 Commenting Guide

Use comments to explain:
- **What type it is**: "This is a FUNCTION" or "This is a METHOD"
- **What it does**: Brief description of the calculation
- **Parameters**: What inputs it expects
- **Return value**: What it gives back

Example:
```python
def calculate_hypotenuse(side_a, side_b):
    """
    This is a FUNCTION - calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle
    Parameters: side_a (float), side_b (float)
    Returns: hypotenuse length (float)
    """
    return (side_a**2 + side_b**2)**0.5
```

## 🚀 Getting Started Tips

1. **Start simple**: Get the menu working with just 2 calculations first
2. **Test frequently**: Run your program after adding each new feature
3. **Comment as you go**: Don't wait until the end to add comments
4. **Handle errors**: Think about what could go wrong (invalid input, division by zero)
5. **Use meaningful names**: `calculate_hypotenuse` is better than `calc_h`
