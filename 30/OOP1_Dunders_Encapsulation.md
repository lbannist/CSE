# Python OOP Geometry with Dunders Assignment Guide

## 🎯 Introduction: Understanding Encapsulation and Dunders

Welcome to your Geometry assignment! This project introduces you to **encapsulation**—one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming. Encapsulation means protecting data within a class from being accidentally modified from outside the class.

### Why Encapsulation Matters

Imagine you're building a banking app. You wouldn't want anyone to directly change someone's account balance like this:

```python
# BAD - Anyone can change the balance!
account.balance = 1000000  # Instant millionaire!
```

Instead, you want controlled access through methods:

```python
# GOOD - Controlled through methods
account.deposit(100)  # Must follow rules
account.withdraw(50)  # Can check for sufficient funds
```

### Python's Approach: Naming Conventions

Unlike Java or C++ which use `public`, `private`, and `protected` keywords, Python uses **naming conventions with underscores**:

| Convention | Meaning | Example |
|------------|---------|---------|
| `name` | **Public** - accessible anywhere | `self.radius` |
| `_name` | **Protected** - internal use, but accessible | `self._radius` |
| `__name` | **Private** - strongly discouraged from outside | `self.__radius` |

**Important Note:** Python's privacy is based on *convention*, not enforcement. Even "private" variables can technically be accessed (through name mangling), but **in this course we maintain proper practice** ✅

### What Are Dunders?

**"Dunders"** (double-underscores) are special methods in Python that start and end with `__`. They're fundamental to how Python objects work:

- `__init__`: Constructor - runs when you create an object
- `__str__`: Returns a user-friendly string representation
- `__repr__`: Returns a detailed string for debugging
- `__del__`: Destructor - runs when object is deleted

You'll use these immediately in your first real classes!

## 📋 Assignment Overview

Create a geometry program with three classes that demonstrate:
- Multiple constructors (using default parameters)
- Private instance variables
- Essential dunder methods
- Encapsulation principles

**File name:** `[YourName]_OOP_Geometry.py`

---

## 🏗️ Class Requirements

### **Class 1: Circle**

#### Private Instance Variables (use `__` prefix):
- `__name` (string): The circle's name
- `__radius` (float): The radius in meters
- `__height` (float): The height in meters (0 for flat circles)

#### Constructor Methods:

Python doesn't support multiple constructors like Java, but we can simulate them using **default parameters**:

```python
class Circle:
    """A class representing a circle or cylinder"""
    
    def __init__(self, name, radius, height=0):
        """
        Constructor - Creates a Circle or Cylinder
        
        Parameters:
            name (str): Name of the shape
            radius (float): Radius in meters
            height (float): Height in meters (default=0 for flat circle)
        
        When height=0: Creates a flat circle
        When height>0: Creates a cylinder
        """
        self.__name = name
        self.__radius = radius
        self.__height = height
```

**Usage Examples:**
```python
# First constructor style: flat circle (height defaults to 0)
manhole = Circle("Man Hole", 0.5)

# Second constructor style: cylinder (height specified)
tower = Circle("Tower of Pisa", 20, 80)
```

#### Required Methods:

**1. `get_name(self)` - Getter Method**
```python
def get_name(self):
    """Returns the name of the shape"""
    return self.__name
```

**2. `print_area(self)` - Calculate and Display Area**
- If height is 0 (flat circle): Area = πr²
- If height > 0 (cylinder): Area = 2πr² + 2πrh (two ends + curved surface)
- Use 3.14 for π
- Print format: `"The [name]'s surface area is [area] square meters"`

**3. `print_circumference(self)` - Calculate and Display Circumference**
- Formula: C = 2πr
- Use 3.14 for π
- Print format: `"The [name]'s circumference is [circumference] meters"`

**4. `print_volume(self)` - Calculate and Display Volume**
- If height is 0: Print `"The [name] is not a cylinder. Volume cannot be computed."`
- If height > 0: Calculate V = πr²h and print `"The [name] is a cylinder. It has a volume of [volume] cubic meters"`

**5. `__str__(self)` - Dunder for String Representation**
```python
def __str__(self):
    """Returns user-friendly string when print() is called"""
    shape_type = "cylinder" if self.__height > 0 else "circle"
    return f"{self.__name} (a {shape_type} with radius {self.__radius}m)"
```

**6. `__repr__(self)` - Dunder for Detailed Representation**
```python
def __repr__(self):
    """Returns detailed string for debugging"""
    return f"Circle(name='{self.__name}', radius={self.__radius}, height={self.__height})"
```

---

### **Class 2: Rectangle**

#### Private Instance Variables (use `__` prefix):
- `__name` (string): The rectangle's name
- `__width` (float): Width in meters
- `__length` (float): Length in meters
- `__height` (float): Height in meters (0 for flat rectangles)

#### Constructor Method:

```python
class Rectangle:
    """A class representing a rectangle or rectangular prism"""
    
    def __init__(self, name, width, length, height=0):
        """
        Constructor - Creates a Rectangle or Rectangular Prism
        
        Parameters:
            name (str): Name of the shape
            width (float): Width in meters
            length (float): Length in meters
            height (float): Height in meters (default=0 for flat rectangle)
        
        When height=0: Creates a flat rectangle
        When height>0: Creates a rectangular prism (like a box)
        """
        self.__name = name
        self.__width = width
        self.__length = length
        self.__height = height
```

**Usage Examples:**
```python
# First constructor style: flat rectangle
paper = Rectangle("Paper", 0.216, 0.28)

# Second constructor style: rectangular prism
printer = Rectangle("Printer", 0.36, 0.32, 0.24)
```

#### Required Methods:

**1. `get_name(self)` - Getter Method**

**2. `print_area(self)` - Calculate and Display Surface Area**
- If height is 0 (flat): Area = width × length
- If height > 0 (prism): Area = 2(wl + wh + lh)
- Print format: `"The [name]'s surface area is [area] square meters"`

**3. `print_perimeter(self)` - Calculate and Display Base Perimeter**
- Formula: P = 2(width + length)
- Print format: `"The [name]'s perimeter is [perimeter] meters"`

**4. `print_volume(self)` - Calculate and Display Volume**
- Formula: V = width × length × height
- If height is 0: Volume will be 0
- Print format: `"The [name]'s volume is [volume] cubic meters"`

**5. `__str__(self)` and `__repr__(self)` - Dunder Methods**

Similar to Circle class, create user-friendly and detailed representations.

---

### **Class 3: GeometryMain**

This is your main program that creates objects and tests all functionality.

```python
def main():
    """Main program to test Circle and Rectangle classes"""
    
    # Create list to store all shapes
    shapes = []
    
    # Create circles
    manhole = Circle("Man Hole", 0.5)  # Flat circle
    tower = Circle("Tower of Pisa", 20, 80)  # Cylinder
    
    shapes.append(manhole)
    shapes.append(tower)
    
    # Create rectangles
    paper = Rectangle("Paper", 0.216, 0.28)  # Flat rectangle
    printer = Rectangle("Printer", 0.36, 0.32, 0.24)  # Prism
    
    shapes.append(paper)
    shapes.append(printer)
    
    # Print all shape details
    print("=== ALL SHAPES ===\n")
    for shape in shapes:
        print(f"{shape.get_name()} has the following properties:")
        shape.print_area()
        
        if isinstance(shape, Circle):
            shape.print_circumference()
        elif isinstance(shape, Rectangle):
            shape.print_perimeter()
        
        shape.print_volume()
        print()  # Blank line
    
    # Test __str__ dunder
    print("\n=== TESTING __str__ DUNDER ===")
    for shape in shapes:
        print(shape)  # This calls __str__
    
    # Test __repr__ dunder
    print("\n=== TESTING __repr__ DUNDER ===")
    for shape in shapes:
        print(repr(shape))  # This calls __repr__
    
    # Search functionality
    search_shapes(shapes)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

## 🔍 Search Functionality

Implement a search function that allows users to find shapes by name:

```python
def search_shapes(shape_list):
    """
    FUNCTION - Searches for a shape by name
    Parameter: shape_list (list of Circle and Rectangle objects)
    """
    while True:
        print("\n=== SHAPE SEARCH ===")
        search_name = input("Enter shape name to search (or 'exit' to quit): ").strip()
        
        if search_name.lower() == 'exit':
            break
        
        found = False
        for shape in shape_list:
            if shape.get_name().lower() == search_name.lower():
                print(f"\n✓ Found: {shape}")
                print(f"\n{shape.get_name()} has the following properties:")
                shape.print_area()
                
                if isinstance(shape, Circle):
                    shape.print_circumference()
                elif isinstance(shape, Rectangle):
                    shape.print_perimeter()
                
                shape.print_volume()
                found = True
                break
        
        if not found:
            print(f"✗ Shape '{search_name}' not found in collection.")
```

## 💡 Understanding Key Concepts

### 1. Default Parameters (Simulating Multiple Constructors)

Python doesn't have method overloading like Java, but default parameters achieve the same goal:

```python
# In Java, you'd need two separate constructors:
# Circle(String name, double radius)
# Circle(String name, double radius, double height)

# In Python, use default parameters:
def __init__(self, name, radius, height=0):
    # Works for both cases!
```

### 2. Private Variables with Name Mangling

When you use `__variable`, Python performs "name mangling":

```python
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, name, radius):
        self.__radius = radius  # Private

# Outside the class:
c = Circle("Test", 5)
print(c.__radius)  # ❌ AttributeError!
print(c._Circle__radius)  # ⚠️ Technically works but DON'T DO THIS!
```

**Best Practice:** Use getter/setter methods to access private variables:

```python
def get_radius(self):
    return self.__radius

def set_radius(self, radius):
    if radius > 0:  # Can add validation!
        self.__radius = radius
```

### 3. The `isinstance()` Function

Use `isinstance()` to check what type of object you have:

```python
if isinstance(shape, Circle):
    shape.print_circumference()  # Only circles have this
elif isinstance(shape, Rectangle):
    shape.print_perimeter()  # Only rectangles have this
```

### 4. `__str__` vs `__repr__`

**`__str__`**: For end users (readable)
```python
print(circle)  # "Man Hole (a circle with radius 0.5m)"
```

**`__repr__`**: For developers (unambiguous)
```python
print(repr(circle))  # "Circle(name='Man Hole', radius=0.5, height=0)"
```

**Pro Tip:** `__repr__` should ideally let you recreate the object:
```python
circle = eval(repr(circle))  # Should work!
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Program

### Test 1: Circle Calculations
- **Man Hole** (r=0.5, h=0):
  - Area = πr² = 3.14 × 0.5² = **0.785 m²**
  - Circumference = 2πr = 2 × 3.14 × 0.5 = **3.14 m**
  - Volume = Not a cylinder

- **Tower of Pisa** (r=20, h=80):
  - Area = 2πr² + 2πrh = 2(3.14)(20²) + 2(3.14)(20)(80) = **12,566.4 m²**
  - Circumference = 2πr = 2 × 3.14 × 20 = **125.6 m**
  - Volume = πr²h = 3.14 × 20² × 80 = **100,480 m³**

### Test 2: Rectangle Calculations
- **Paper** (w=0.216, l=0.28, h=0):
  - Area = wl = 0.216 × 0.28 = **0.06048 m²**
  - Perimeter = 2(w+l) = 2(0.216 + 0.28) = **0.992 m**
  - Volume = **0 m³**

- **Printer** (w=0.36, l=0.32, h=0.24):
  - Area = 2(wl + wh + lh) = 2(0.1152 + 0.0864 + 0.0768) = **0.5568 m²**
  - Perimeter = 2(0.36 + 0.32) = **1.36 m**
  - Volume = wlh = 0.36 × 0.32 × 0.24 = **0.027648 m³**

### Test 3: Dunder Methods
```python
# Test __str__
print(manhole)  # Should be user-friendly

# Test __repr__
print(repr(manhole))  # Should show all details

# Test that print() uses __str__
for shape in shapes:
    print(shape)  # Calls __str__ automatically
```

### Test 4: Encapsulation
```python
# This should NOT work (and you shouldn't do it):
try:
    print(manhole.__radius)  # Should raise AttributeError
except AttributeError:
    print("✓ Private variable is protected!")

# This SHOULD work:
print(manhole.get_name())  # Uses getter method
```

---

## 🚀 Extension Challenges (Optional)

### Challenge 1: Add Validation
Prevent invalid shapes:
```python
def __init__(self, name, radius, height=0):
    if radius <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Radius must be positive!")
    if height < 0:
        raise ValueError("Height cannot be negative!")
    # ... set variables
```

### Challenge 2: Add More Dunders
Implement comparison dunders:
```python
def __eq__(self, other):
    """Check if two circles are equal"""
    if not isinstance(other, Circle):
        return False
    return self.__radius == other.__radius

def __lt__(self, other):
    """Check if this circle is smaller"""
    return self.__radius < other.__radius
```

### Challenge 3: Add Setter Methods
Create setters with validation:
```python
def set_radius(self, radius):
    """Setter for radius with validation"""
    if radius > 0:
        self.__radius = radius
    else:
        print("Error: Radius must be positive")
```

### Challenge 4: Create a Sphere Class
Extend your program with a new shape!

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Accessing Private Variables Directly
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Don't do this!
print(circle.__radius)

# ✅ CORRECT - Use getter method
print(circle.get_radius())
```

### Mistake 2: Forgetting `self` Parameter
```python
# ❌ WRONG
def print_area():
    return 3.14 * radius ** 2

# ✅ CORRECT
def print_area(self):
    return 3.14 * self.__radius ** 2
```

### Mistake 3: Printing Inside Methods That Should Return
```python
# ❌ WRONG for get_name()
def get_name(self):
    print(self.__name)

# ✅ CORRECT
def get_name(self):
    return self.__name
```

### Mistake 4: Not Using `isinstance()` Before Method Calls
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Will crash if shape is Rectangle
for shape in shapes:
    shape.print_circumference()  # Rectangles don't have this!

# ✅ CORRECT
for shape in shapes:
    if isinstance(shape, Circle):
        shape.print_circumference()
```

## 📚 Reference: Public vs Protected vs Private

| Type | Syntax | Accessible From | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Public** | `self.name` | Anywhere | Public API, frequently accessed |
| **Protected** | `self._name` | Class & subclasses | Internal use, inheritance |
| **Private** | `self.__name` | Class only (name mangled) | Strong encapsulation needed |

**Remember:** In this course, we maintain proper practice by not accessing private variables from outside the class! ✅
