At school, VS Code and the Python IDE are already installed. 
At home, you will need to install VS Code and the newest IDE

Now that everything is installed and ready, Open VS Code

On the left there is a series of icons, look for the one with 4 blocks, 1 should be tiled.  That is the extensions.  Click on it and it will show what is installed and what is available.  Search for **Python** and install the newest version of Python and install it.  Also install the **Python Environment**, **Python Debugger**, and **Pylance**.

Great, now click on the 1st icon that looks like two pages.  Click on **Open Folder** and make a folder somewhere that is easy to find, like in Documents.   This is the best place to store your folders and files that you create in this course.
