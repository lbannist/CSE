# 🎯 Introduction: The Guessing Game

Welcome to your Guessing Game assignment! This project brings together everything you've learned so far — `print()`, `input()`, variables, data types like `int()` and `str()`, and `if` statements — into one fun, interactive program.

## The Problem It Solves

Imagine you want to make a game where the computer "thinks" of a number and the player tries to guess it. Without variables and `if` statements, you couldn't store the secret number or react differently to a right or wrong answer.

With what you know now, you *can* build this:

```python
secret_number = 7
guess = int(input("What is your guess? "))

if guess == secret_number:
    print("You got it!")
if guess < secret_number:
    print("Too low!")
if guess > secret_number:
    print("Too high!")
```

Simple — but already a real, working game!

## Understanding the Key Ideas

| Concept | What It Does | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `input()` | Gets text from the user | `name = input("Your name? ")` |
| `int()` | Converts text to a whole number | `guess = int(guess)` |
| `str()` | Converts a number to text | `str(secret_number)` |
| `if` statement | Runs code only when a condition is true | `if guess == secret_number:` |

Think of it this way:
- `input()` always gives you a **string** — even if the user types a number
- You need `int()` to turn that string into a number you can compare
- You need `str()` to turn numbers back into text when printing them alongside words

## 📋 Assignment Overview

Build an interactive number guessing game that welcomes the player by name, takes their guess, and tells them whether they were correct, too high, or too low.

**File name:** `[YourName]_GuessingGame.py`

---

## 📚 Key Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment you will:

- Use `print()` to display formatted, readable output
- Use `input()` to collect information from the user
- Store values in **variables** and use them throughout the program
- Convert between data types using `int()` and `str()`
- Use `if` statements to make your program respond differently based on the player's guess
- Combine string variables with `+` to create personalised messages

---

## ✅ Requirements Checklist

Your program **must** include all of the following:

- [ ] A welcome banner printed with `print()`
- [ ] A `secret_number` variable storing the number to guess (between 1 and 10)
- [ ] An `input()` that asks the player for their **name**
- [ ] A personalised greeting using the player's name
- [ ] An `input()` that asks the player for their **guess**
- [ ] The guess converted to an integer using `int()`
- [ ] An `if` statement for when the guess is **correct**
- [ ] An `if` statement for when the guess is **too low**
- [ ] An `if` statement for when the guess is **too high**
- [ ] Each outcome prints the secret number using `str()`
- [ ] A closing message thanking the player

---

## 📤 Expected Output Example

Here is what a complete, correct run of your program should look like:

```
================================
   Welcome to the Guessing Game!
================================
I am thinking of a number between 1 and 10.

What is your name? Sarah
Hello, Sarah! Let's play!

What is your guess? 4

Too low! Try a bigger number next time.
The secret number was 7.

Thanks for playing!
```

And if the player guesses correctly:

```
What is your guess? 7

🎉 Amazing! You got it, Sarah!
The secret number was 7.

Thanks for playing!
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Your Program

Run your program **at least three times** to check all three outcomes work correctly:

| Test | Your Input | Expected Result |
|---|---|---|
| Correct guess | `7` | "Amazing! You got it!" message |
| Too low | Any number below 7 | "Too low!" message |
| Too high | Any number above 7 | "Too high!" message |

**Before submitting, ask yourself:**
- Does the name appear in the greeting?
- Does each `if` branch print the secret number?
- Does the program run without any errors?

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Forgetting `int()` on the guess**
```python
# ❌ This compares a string to a number — will never be equal!
guess = input("What is your guess? ")
if guess == secret_number:

# ✅ Convert first
guess = int(input("What is your guess? "))
```

**Forgetting `str()` when printing the secret number**
```python
# ❌ This will crash — you can't join a number and a string with +
print("The secret number was " + secret_number + ".")

# ✅ Wrap it in str()
print("The secret number was " + str(secret_number) + ".")
```

**Using `=` instead of `==` in your if statement**
```python
# ❌ Single = assigns a value, it doesn't compare
if guess = secret_number:

# ✅ Double == checks if they are equal
if guess == secret_number:
```

**Not adding spaces in your greeting string**
```python
# ❌ Produces "Hello,Sarah!"
print("Hello," + name + "!")

# ✅ Include the space inside the quotes
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

## 🚀 Extension Challenges

Finished early? Try one or more of these challenges. They all use only what you already know!

---

### ⭐ Challenge 1 — Personalised Feedback
Use the player's name in the "too low" and "too high" messages to make the game feel more alive.

```python
if guess < secret_number:
    print("Too low, " + name + "! Think bigger.")
```

*Skills used: string concatenation, variables*

---

### ⭐⭐ Challenge 2 — Even or Odd Hint
Before the player guesses, give them a hint about whether the secret number is even or odd. This introduces the **modulo operator** `%`, which gives the remainder after division.

```python
if secret_number % 2 == 0:
    print("Hint: the number is even.")
if secret_number % 2 != 0:
    print("Hint: the number is odd.")
```

*Skills used: if statements, the `%` operator*

---

### ⭐⭐ Challenge 3 — Three Guesses (No Loops!)
Give the player three chances to guess. Copy your input and if block three times. It will feel repetitive — and that's the point! You'll understand exactly why loops are so useful when you learn them next.

```python
guess1 = int(input("Guess 1: "))
# ... your if statements ...

guess2 = int(input("Guess 2: "))
# ... your if statements ...

guess3 = int(input("Guess 3: "))
# ... your if statements ...
```

*Skills used: variables, int(), if statements — repeated deliberately*

---

### ⭐⭐⭐ Challenge 4 — Guess Tracking
Store each of the player's three guesses in separate variables and print a summary at the end.

```python
print("You guessed " + str(guess1) + ", " + str(guess2) + ", and " + str(guess3) + ".")
```

*Skills used: variables, str(), string concatenation*

---

### ⭐⭐⭐ Challenge 5 — Simple Scoring
Start the player with a score of 10. Use `if` statements to subtract points based on how far off their guess was — without using any functions you haven't learned yet.

```python
score = 10

if guess < secret_number:
    difference = secret_number - guess
    if difference >= 5:
        score = score - 3
    if difference < 5:
        score = score - 1

print("Your score: " + str(score))
```

*Skills used: variables, arithmetic, nested if statements*

---

### ⭐⭐⭐ Challenge 6 — Two Player Mode
Player 1 enters the secret number secretly, then a wall of blank `print()` lines scrolls it off the screen. Player 2 then tries to guess. No new concepts needed — just creative use of what you know.

```python
secret_number = int(input("Player 1 — enter a secret number: "))

# Scroll it off the screen
print()
print()
# ... add about 20 more print() lines ...

guess = int(input("Player 2 — what is your guess? "))
```

*Skills used: input(), int(), if statements, creative use of print()*
